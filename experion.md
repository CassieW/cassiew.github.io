			<h2>Long History, Fresh Start</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Since joining Honeywell at beginning of 2018 fresh out of college, I have been working with Experion Batch team as a software engineer. Working at a multinational conglomerate business, I was not too shocked to see developer comments from 90s’ here and there in our huge code base. In fact, our team still owns some products which are built upon legacy system dated back to 1980s’(learn more about product timeline of Experion PKS). While maintaining the infrastructure by adding modules and extensions may sound like a viable solution from technical perspective, User Experience, on the other hand, is compromised inevitably when it comes to the long drop-down list, rows and rows of window tabs, lack of guidance or feedback… the list goes on.  </p>
		<p>My concern since Day 1 was no news to the team, nor the management and leadership. Focusing on Velocity Product Development, Honeywell is launching a whole new process called Z21, which is going to reduce innovation cycle times in half. Batch team, as one of the pilot projects of Z21, has adopted Agile software development and moreover, modern technologies to build lightweight, user-friendly product. </p>

			<h2>Procedure Explorer</h2>

		<p>Currently in Batch Operations, operators are often “flying blind” not knowing when critical steps are coming up. According to our customer research, throughput is compromised because operators do not have the time-based visualizations to prepare for upcoming tasks. Knowing what is coming next and when is key to keeping the plant running at maximum efficiency.</p>
