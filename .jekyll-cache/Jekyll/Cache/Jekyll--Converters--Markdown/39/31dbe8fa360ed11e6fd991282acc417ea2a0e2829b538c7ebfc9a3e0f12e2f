			<h2>Long History, Fresh Start</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Since joining Honeywell at beginning of 2018 fresh out of college, I have been working with Experion Batch team as a software engineer. Working at a multinational conglomerate business, I was not too shocked to see developer comments from 90s’ here and there in our huge code base. In fact, our team still owns some products which are built upon legacy system dated back to 1980s’(learn more about product timeline of Experion PKS). While maintaining the infrastructure by adding modules and extensions may sound like a viable solution from technical perspective, User Experience, on the other hand, is compromised inevitably when it comes to the long drop-down list, rows and rows of window tabs, lack of guidance or feedback… the list goes on.  </p>
		<p>My concern since Day 1 was no news to the team, nor the management and leadership. Focusing on Velocity Product Development, Honeywell is launching a whole new process called Z21, which is going to reduce innovation cycle times in half. Batch team, as one of the pilot projects of Z21, has adopted Agile software development and moreover, modern technologies to build user-centered product. </p>

			<h2>Procedure Explorer</h2>

		<p>
		Currently in Batch Operations, operators are often “flying blind” not knowing when critical steps are coming up. According to our customer research, throughput is sometimes compromised because operators do not have the time-based visualizations to prepare for upcoming tasks. Knowing what is coming next and when is key to keeping the plant running at maximum efficiency.

        While the majority of my work in this project is focusing on front-end development, I have certainly picked up a lot of useful design practices through the workshop as well as sync-up sessions with UX designer. At the same time, implementing features for a working product makes me dive deep into every design detail. As the development goes I was able to understand the patterns and principles better, and to come up with questions and feedback to support design.

        After going through iterations of User Needs Analysis, we landed on a lighter-weight web-based application as a reliable solution to help customer achieve their golden batch. Procedure Explorer is an intuitive recipe visualization interface that facilitates seamless workflow to operate and control of batch processes.

        <h3>Adaptive Web Design</h3>
        <blockquote>
        "Adaptive design will (theoretically) ensure the best user experience according to whichever circumstances the user is in to interface. As the name suggests, the design adapts to the user’s situational needs and capabilities. As designers, we can show users that we’re in tune with their needs by giving them the right solution without asking for input.
        <br />
        A strength of adaptive design is that it feels more relevant to the modern user experience, whereas responsive design shows a more desktop-centric approach (with the demands of other devices taking a secondary, almost passive place). Let’s take a literal example; if you were driving through a long tunnel, wouldn’t you rather have a GPS screen that adapts to the environment and adjusts its brightness? That context-based performance and usability is reassuring, at the same time confirming that your smart device is smart enough to adapt and be extra useful.”
