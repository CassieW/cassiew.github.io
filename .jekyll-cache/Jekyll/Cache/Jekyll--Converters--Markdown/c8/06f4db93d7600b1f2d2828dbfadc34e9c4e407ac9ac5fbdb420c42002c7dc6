			<h2>Unexpected, yet Fruitful</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
        With the initial intent to just satisfy public service graduate requirement at Tulane, my internship with City of New Orleans turned out a fruitful learning experience beyond expectation. Without preparing for anything truly technical, I walked in Sara‚Äôs office at City Hall to discuss my upcoming internship with City of New Orleans Office of Information Technology &amp; Innovation. Serving as a Deputy Chief Information Officer for the City, Sara Estes White (Cohen) shared her ambition on the entire lifespan of technology, from K-12 STEM and computer science advocacy, digital literacy, and fostering civic engagement and innovation, to technology workforce development, implementation and management of enterprise technology systems. While I was surprised about the great enthusiasm on technology for a government institution, I pitched in with my background in computer science and experience on web development.		</p>
		<p>
        The outcome of the meeting was an exciting hands-on project ‚Äì developing enhancement on user experience for NoticeMe, an early notification tool for land use changes in the City of New Orleans.

			<h2>UX in Map Application</h2>
		</header>
		<p>
        When it comes to a map-based application, things become a little complicated. There is a lot of data generated in everyday usage, via a targeted search, or simply clicking around to explore the area. As a user, I would like to mark Area of Interest and have them available on the view for easy access every time I log in; at the same time, saving a browsing history in certain time span would be helpful in case I forgot to mark important place down. Moreover, I would like to filter entire map based on certain criteria, like under construction or planned construction, to see my potential Area of Interest.
		</p>
		<p>
        To support these enhancements, I need a comprehensive understanding on the architecture, as well as technology used for implementation. With my mentor‚Äôs help, I started with my first task ‚Äì adding the ability to toggle data display.
        </p>
        <p>
        In ArcGIS API, a map view is built upon layers. Data points are dropped on a layer, and we can choose to show or hide it. Toggling the data display is just switching between different layers ‚Äì straight forward enough. Thanks to the updated documentation, it did not take me too much time studying the API to figure out which layers to pick.
        </p>
        <h3>Adaptive Web Design</h3>
        <blockquote>
        "Adaptive design will (theoretically) ensure the best user experience according to whichever circumstances the user is in to interface. As the name suggests, the design adapts to the user‚Äôs situational needs and capabilities. As designers, we can show users that we‚Äôre in tune with their needs by giving them the right solution without asking for input.
        <br />
        A strength of adaptive design is that it feels more relevant to the modern user experience, whereas responsive design shows a more desktop-centric approach (with the demands of other devices taking a secondary, almost passive place). Let‚Äôs take a literal example; if you were driving through a long tunnel, wouldn‚Äôt you rather have a GPS screen that adapts to the environment and adjusts its brightness? That context-based performance and usability is reassuring, at the same time confirming that your smart device is smart enough to adapt and be extra useful.‚Äù

        Our users work in complicated, stressful, distracting environments: an oil refinery plant in Texas producing over 5,000 tons of petrochemical products, or a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Germany running 2-million-dollar batches per day. Users could be sitting in the control room, multitasking on four separate displays while three different alarms going on in the background. They could be standing in the plant near a mixer equipment, working on a single-screen console station at the 5th hour of 12-hour night shift. They could be running back and forth between control room and the field, with a pen and a notebook in hand to write down parameters to be checked‚Ä¶ With Procedure Explorer, our target is to resolve customers‚Äô most concerned pain point ‚Äì user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once a batch finishes configuration and kicks off running, hundreds of configured parameters and run-time data is generated. To work this massive amount of information into an intuitive visualization without compromising the legibility, it requires us to design adaptively and inclusively on the details:

        <h3>Progressive Disclosure</h3>
        <blockquote>
        "Progressive disclosure defers advanced or rarely used features to a secondary screen, making applications easier to learn and less error-prone."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
        An inevitable dilemma for interaction design:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
            Users want <b>power</b>, features, and enough options to handle all of their special needs. An operator would like to skip all the details and get straight to the error block, while an engineer needs some essential parameters to troubleshoot specific scenario.
            </li>
            <li>
            Users want <b>simplicity</b>; they don't have time to learn a profusion of features in enough depth to select the few that are optimal for their needs. For example, users struggle to find their target in a context menu when it lists more than 10 items, or expands more than two levels - it takes forever for one single action.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        <i>Progressive disclosure</i> is one of the best ways to satisfy both of these conflicting requirements. It's a simple, yet powerful idea:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Initially, show users only a few of the most important options.
            </li>
            <li>
            Offer a larger set of specialized options upon request. Disclose these secondary features only if a user asks for them, meaning that most users can proceed with their tasks without worrying about this added complexity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As we introduce Procedure Explorer as a user-friendly replacement for functionalities in existing system, progressive disclosure makes the transition happens naturally: with one action users bring up a set of limited functions, they are designed intuitively leading to next level of information, while not overwhelm users with the options.
