        <h3>Hi, I'm Cassie. </h3>
        <p> I am a software engineer learning to wear designer hat and solve problems for our everyday life. <br />
        Currently I optimize software solution to batch applications such as large pharmaceutical, specialty chemical companies at
        <a href="https://www.honeywellprocess.com/en-US/online_campaigns/experion-pks/Pages/batch.html" target="_blank">Honeywell</a> in Philly,
        where I met a group of student entrepreneurs digitalizing their business ideas.
        <br />
        I grew up in Guangzhou, southern China. I speak three languages fluently and have lived in different countries. <br />
        I love photography and videography, lately playing with my new anamorphic lens.
